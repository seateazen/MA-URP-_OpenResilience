QGIS graphic model algorithm I used and developed for my master's thesis on developing an exposure analysis of critical infrastructure facilities in Taguig City, Metro Manila, Philippines from floods and the west valley fault.

ABSTRACT

The identification of critical infrastructure facilities for climate and disaster risk
assessments that forms part of the resilient land use plan is essential. The case study
utilized the application of a geo-analytics platform using free and open source software
for geographic information systems (FOSS4G), namely QGIS; in developing the multihazard
risk maps of critical infrastructure facilities in Taguig City, Philippines.
The research presented a case study for a workflow for geo-spatial analysis with
direct application in hazard risk mapping for floods, active fault lines, and waterway
easements. A review of open data portals was also conducted which discussed the
limitations and opportunities of existing official data repositories. A supplementary
online survey was conducted to understand the knowledge, skills, attitudes, perceptions,
and perceptions to GIS. The survey provided insights on respondents mostly from local
planning and development offices that they are open to improving institutional capacity
and professional capabilities in GIS, particularly in QGIS. A brief comparison review of
different spatial decision support systems for climate and disaster risk assessment was
also conducted that revealed important ways forward in further developing open tools for
disaster risk assessment. And a proposed spatial decision support system framework was
included in line with the graphical model algorithm developed within QGIS.
Lastly, this study recommends the opening of more publicly funded and produced
spatial data to unlimited use cases to all users without license restrictions. Open
knowledge, and an open access to this information not only promotes transparency but
also innovation and the ability of more users in the disaster risk reduction and
humanitarian action community for independent analysis. The teaching, and promotion of
FOSS4G at the academe or at professional courses should be continued or started since
this will equip future GIS practitioners, and environmental planning professionals with
the flexibility in applying geospatial analysis after leaving university. FOSS4G is a low,
near-zero cost alternative. It presents the opportunity to cash strapped non government
organizations, and municipal governments that have limited sources of income to
generate their spatial analysis. This research is a proof of concept that FOSS4G can do
what other proprietary GIS do for free in disaster risk assessments.
